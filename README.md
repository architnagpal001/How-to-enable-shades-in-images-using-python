# How-to-enable-shades-in-images-using-python

If you are about to change the shade of a png file ,
you don't need the pillow module 
But, if you need to change the jpg/jpeg file, you need PILLOW module.
I recommend to use PILLOW module whatever the image is, as there is no disadvantageof it.

You should have this module installed in your pc 
pip install pillow
